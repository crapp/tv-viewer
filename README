About
-----
TV-Viewer is a small application to watch and record TV.
It is independent from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or Gnome,
because it uses the Tk toolkit.


Requirements
------------
In order to install and use the program you'll need:
 * Tcl and Tk >= 8.5
 * ivtv-tune and v4l2-ctl (ivtv-utils).
 * Mplayer >= 1.0rc2 (A most recent version of mplayer is recommended)
 * xdg-utils

It is recommended to install,
 * tkimg (If you use Tcl/Tk < 8.6)
as well.


Optional Features
-----------------

TV-Viewer comes with some optional features. You may choose if you want 
them to be installed or not.

* tktray - A Tk library to dock Tk to the system tray. (default: enabled)
           Depends on glibc; libxdmcp; libxau; libxcb; libx11
           These dependencies should be installed by default on every linux
           distribution.

If you do not want to install one of this features use the switch

--enable-FEATURE=ARG (e.g. --enable-tktray=yes ; --enable-tktray=no)

with the configure.tcl script.


Installation
------------
Installing TV-Viewer is done by the following 2 commands:

$ ./configure.tcl (configures build environment and creates install.tcl)

% ./install.tcl (you may need root privileges)


For more configuration details run 
$ ./configure.tcl --help

If there are any errors during installation, check your build environment and 
the file "./config.log". Otherwise contact us and/or have a look at the manual.

Uninstall
