About
-----
TV-Viewer is a small application to watch and record TV.
It is independent from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or Gnome,
because it uses the Tk toolkit.


Requirements
------------
In order to install and use the program you'll need:
 * Tcl and Tk >= 8.5
 * ivtv-tune and v4l2-ctl (ivtv-utils).
 * Mplayer >= 1.0rc2 (A most recent version of mplayer is recommended)

It is recommended to install,
 * xdg-utils
 * tkimg (If you use Tcl/Tk < 8.6)
as well.

Installation
------------
Installing TV-Viewer is done by the following command:
(as root)
% ./tv-viewer_install.sh

Don't try to use "sh tv-viewer_install.sh" this won't work.
If there are any errors during installation, check your build environment
and try to find the error, otherwise contact the author, or use sourceforge.net.

See the user guide for details.

$ tv-viewer
on a console.
There are several command line options. Run
