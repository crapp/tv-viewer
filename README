About
-----
TV-Viewer is a small application to watch and record TV.
It is independent from a special Desktop Environment like KDE or Gnome,
because it uses the Tk toolkit.


Requirements
------------
In order to install and use the program you'll need:
 * Tcl and Tk >= 8.5
 * ivtv-tune and v4l2-ctl (ivtv-utils).
 * Mplayer >= 1.0rc2 (A most recent version of mplayer is recommended)
 * xdg-utils

It is recommended to install,
 * tkimg (If you use Tcl/Tk < 8.6)
as well.


Installation
------------
Installing TV-Viewer is done by 2 steps. First of all you need to 
configure your build environment. Therefore you have to run the 
configure.tcl script. Standard values should be ok for most users.
Otherwise use "--help" to see all command line options.

% chmod a+x ./configure.tcl
% ./configure.tcl

If all goes well you will get an install script "./install.tcl", else check
your build environment. You might find the answers in the file 
"./config.log"
Many people encounter problems if they have more than one version of Tcl/Tk
installed. Please make sure, the Symlinks /usr/bin/wish and /usr/bin/tclsh
point at least on version 8.5. Debian / *buntu users may use update
alternatives to solve this problem
("sudo update-alternatives --config wish" and/or "--config tclsh").

Now make the file "./install.tcl" executable

% chmod a+x ./install.tcl
and run it as root
% sudo ./install.tcl

TV-Viewer is now installed, for more details visit the TV-Viewer Wiki
(http://tv-viewer.sourceforge.net)


Uninstall
---------

You can uninstall TV-Viewer with the installation script. This will
delete all program files but your configuration will still be present
("~/.tv-viewer/").

% ./install.tcl --uninstal


Optional Features
-----------------

TV-Viewer comes with some optional features. You may choose if you want 
them to be installed or not.

* tktray - A Tk library to dock Tk to the system tray.

If you do not want to install one of this features use the switch

--disable-FEATURE (e.g. --disable-tktray)

with the configure.tcl script.


Usage
-----
To run TV-Viewer just type
% tv-viewer
on a console.
There are several command line options. Run
% tv-viewer --help
for details.
For basic usage informations have a look at the man page.
% man tv-viewer
